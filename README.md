# 🐍 Beginner Python Projects

A collection of fun beginner-friendly **Python mini-projects** that helped me learn the basics of programming.  
Each project focuses on a specific concept like loops, conditionals, random numbers, and user input.

## 🧩 What I Learned

* Using the **`random`** module
* Getting and validating **user input**
